# AJAX Day One

## Basic Exercise

__What is AJAX?__
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

__What is Web 2.0, how many Web 2.0 websites do you know?__
Audience participatory web, e.g. Youtube, Instagram, Flickr

__Could you explain the AJAX workflow?__
The browser opens an XMLHTTPRequest to the server. The server processes the request (e.g. pulls the data from a database) and then responds. The browser receives the response and displays the result.

__What is the XMLHttpRequest object responsible for?__
The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to request data from a web server.

__Could you compare XML and JSON data formats?__
Both JSON and XML can be used to receive data from a web server. They have a different format to represent the same data.

## Intermediate Exercise
In this example, you should create an XML file which will contain data about your favorite songs. You should provide at least 20 songs with this data: title, artist, country, genre, year.

Now use the XML file that you have created in the previous example and load it into the HTML page using AJAX. You should create a nice template you can use Bootstrap or plain HTML/CSS/JS. Be creative! :)

## Challenge (two solutions)
Using Ajax, create a registration form for your website, which will check if an email already exists in the database. If the email already exists, the message "this email is already in use" should appear on the screen (WITHOUT clicking submit.) 

If you still have time, think of other options where you can use Ajax in your projects (e.g. force a user to repeat password and let it check if the password matches).
